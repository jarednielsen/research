    "# Exercise 3 - Nested Parallelism\n",
    "\n",
    "**GOAL:** The goal of this exercise is to show how to create nested tasks by calling a remote function inside of another remote function.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you will implement the structure of a parallel hyperparameter sweep which trains a number of models in parallel. Each model will be trained using parallel gradient computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Concepts for this Exercise - Nested Remote Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Remote functions can call other functions. For example, consider the following.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "@ray.remote\n",
    "def f():\n",
    "    return 1\n",
    "\n",
    "@ray.remote\n",
    "def g():\n",
    "    # Call f 4 times and return the resulting object IDs.\n",
    "    return [f.remote() for _ in range(4)]\n",
    "\n",
    "@ray.remote\n",
    "def h():\n",
    "    # Call f 4 times, block until those 4 tasks finish,\n",
    "    # retrieve the results, and return the values.\n",
    "    return ray.get([f.remote() for _ in range(4)])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then calling `g` and `h` produces the following behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> ray.get(g.remote())\n",
    "[ObjectID(b1457ba0911ae84989aae86f89409e953dd9a80e),\n",
    " ObjectID(7c14a1d13a56d8dc01e800761a66f09201104275),\n",
    " ObjectID(99763728ffc1a2c0766a2000ebabded52514e9a6),\n",
    " ObjectID(9c2f372e1933b04b2936bb6f58161285829b9914)]\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> ray.get(h.remote())\n",
    "[1, 1, 1, 1]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**One limitation** is that the definition of `f` must come before the definitions of `g` and `h` because as soon as `g` is defined, it will be pickled and shipped to the workers, and so if `f` hasn't been defined yet, the definition will be incomplete."

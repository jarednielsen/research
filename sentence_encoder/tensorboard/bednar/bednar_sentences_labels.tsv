1	The Rich Young Man and Amulek In the New Testament, we learn about a rich young man who asked Jesus, Good Master, what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life? The Savior first admonished him to keep the commandments.

1	Jesus said unto him, If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come and follow me.

0	He responded compassionately and described a rebellion against the government about which Moroni was not aware.
1	And then Pahoran declared:  Behold, I say unto you, Moroni, that I do not joy in your great afflictions, yea, it grieves my soul.
1	In your epistle you have censured me, but it mattereth not; I am not angry, but do rejoice in the greatness of your heart.

0	He said: I have tried to follow his counsel.
1	Among other things, I've made lists of what the Book of Mormon is, what it affirms, what it refutes, what it fulfills, what it clarifies, and what it reveals.
0	Looking at the Book of Mormon through these lenses has been an insightful and inspiring exercise! I recommend it to each of you.
0	President Henry B. Eyring likewise emphasized the importance in his life of President Monson's request.
1	He observed:  I have read the Book of Mormon every day for more than 50 years.

0	The happy result for me, and for many of you, has been what the prophet promised.
0	What do you think explains the immediate and heartfelt responses to President Monson's invitation by these two leaders of the Lord's Church?  I am not suggesting that the spiritually strong responses of Amulek, Pahoran, President Nelson, and President Eyring are explained by only one Christlike quality.
0	Certainly, many interrelated attributes and experiences led to the spiritual maturity reflected in the lives of these four noble servants.
1	But the Savior and His prophets have highlighted an essential quality that all of us need to more fully understand and strive to incorporate into our lives.
1	Meekness Please notice the characteristic the Lord used to describe Himself in the following scripture: Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.
1	Instructively, the Savior chose to emphasize meekness from among all the attributes and virtues He potentially could have selected.
0	A similar pattern is evident in a revelation received by the Prophet Joseph Smith in 1829.
0	The Lord declared, Learn of me, and listen to my words; walk in the meekness of my Spirit, and you shall have peace in me.

1	This quality helps us to understand more completely the respective reactions of Amulek, Pahoran, President Nelson, and President Eyring.
1	For example, President Nelson and President Eyring righteously and rapidly responded to President Monson's encouragement to read and study the Book of Mormon.
1	Though both men were serving in important and visible Church positions and had studied the scriptures extensively for decades, they demonstrated in their responses no hesitation or sense of self-importance.
1	Amulek willingly submitted to God's will, accepted a call to preach the gospel, and left behind his comfortable circumstances and familiar relationships.
1	And Pahoran was blessed with perspective and strong self-restraint to act rather than react as he explained to Moroni the challenges arising from a rebellion against the government.
1	The Christlike quality of meekness often is misunderstood in our contemporary world.
1	Meekness is strong, not weak; active, not passive; courageous, not timid; restrained, not excessive; modest, not self-aggrandizing; and gracious, not brash.
1	A meek person is not easily provoked, pretentious, or overbearing and readily acknowledges the accomplishments of others.
1	Whereas humility generally denotes dependence upon God and the constant need for His guidance and support, a distinguishing characteristic of meekness is a particular spiritual receptivity to learning both from the Holy Ghost and from people who may seem less capable, experienced, or educated, who may not hold important positions, or who otherwise may not appear to have much to contribute.

1	Meekness a Christlike Attribute and a Spiritual Gift Meekness is an attribute developed through desire, the righteous exercise of moral agency, and striving always to retain a remission of our sins.
1	It also is a spiritual gift for which we appropriately can seek.
1	We should remember, however, the purposes for which such a blessing is given, even to benefit and serve the children of God.
1	As we come unto and follow the Savior, we increasingly and incrementally are enabled to become more like Him.
1	We are empowered by the Spirit with disciplined self-restraint and a settled and calm demeanor.
1	Thus, meek is what we become as disciples of the Master and not just something we do.
0	Moses was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and was mighty in words and in deeds.
0	Yet he was very meek, above all the men which were upon the face of the earth.
0	His knowledge and competence could have caused him to be prideful.
1	Instead, the attribute and spiritual gift of meekness with which he was blessed attenuated arrogance in his life and magnified Moses as an instrument to accomplish God's purposes.
0	The Master as an Example of Meekness The most majestic and meaningful examples of meekness are found in the life of the Savior Himself.
1	The Great Redeemer, who descended below all things and suffered, bled, and died to cleanse us from all unrighteousness, tenderly washed the dusty feet of His disciples.
1	Such meekness is a hallmark characteristic of the Lord as a servant and leader.
0	Jesus provides the ultimate example of righteous responsiveness and willing submission as He suffered intense agony in Gethsemane.
1	And when he was at the place, he said unto [His disciples], Pray that ye enter not into temptation.
